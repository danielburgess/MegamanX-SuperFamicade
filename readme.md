#SNES Megaman X - Super Famicade and Copy Protection Circumvention
I've gone through Megaman X and removed all copy protection (SRAM checks, mirroring checks, routines that check to make sure the protection is in place, and checks to make sure the protection for the protection is in place -_-')... This is so I can set about adding SRAM support and support for the Super Famicade control board.

Will soon be adding features similar to my ZAMN hack such as the ability to see lives without entering the menu... etc. More to come.


#Megaman X Series Password Enabler Patches
(Check the MMX,MMX2,MMX3 folders.)

Information originally given by TDOMMX @ ROMHacking.net on how to enable all earned powerups during password entry. 
Without the included patches, enabling these powerups requires a special key combo for each game, or in the case of MMX3, just doesnt allow full powerups with a password.

Patches are included for Megaman X v1.0 and v1.1, as well as MMX2 and MMX3 (US Versions).

MM7 Patch was not included because it would keep make it impossible to play the normal game and instead load the versus game whenever the password was used. Besides (L+R+Start) is pretty easy to use.

Instructions:
-------------
After patching, no special key presses are necessary to activate these.
Enter the password and press START. 
(If other keys are pressed at the same time, it may not work.)
